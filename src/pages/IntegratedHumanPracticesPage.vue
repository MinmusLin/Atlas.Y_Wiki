    <p>We chose the <span class='bold'>EPIC</span> model (Elicit, Prototype, Iterate, Consolidate) as the overarching
      framework for our project. It provides a clear approach that guides us through the entire process, from
      identifying initial problems, designing and testing prototypes, to iterative improvements and final integration.
      Our project aims to optimize the subcellular localization of yeast synthetases, enhancing their efficiency in
      biomanufacturing through molecular tag design. The EPIC model ensures that each stage of technical development
      stays closely aligned with our core objectives, while also incorporating societal and industry needs to guarantee
      practicality and sustainability. It not only helps us define the challenges in enzyme localization during the
      problem-identification phase, but also allows us to validate our solutions through small-scale testing during the
      prototype design phase. By continuously refining our tool through feedback loops, the EPIC model has become the
      key methodology connecting the entire project, driving the deep integration of technology and demand, and enabling
      the final functional integration and application.</p>

      that the software's user-friendliness needs improvement, especially the user guide, which should be more
      comprehensive to help new users get started quickly. Based on these suggestions, we plan to optimize the user
      interface, improve the user manual, and expand software features in the next version to meet a broader range of
      research needs.</p>

    <p>On August 28, 2024, we participated in the Tongji-Westlake iGEM cross-college exchange meeting. During the
      meeting, we engaged in discussions with the team responsible for the Model section from Westlake University. The
      focus was on exploring different approaches to embedding models into projects, which provided us with new insights
      and strategies for improving the modeling aspect of our own project. This collaboration helped refine our
      understanding of model integration and opened up possibilities for more effective implementation in future
      work.</p>
    <h3>4.6 Tongji University iGEM Exchange Meeting</h3>
    <p>On September 14, 2024, we participated in a Tongji University iGEM exchange meeting with several professors from
      the School of Life Science and Technology. During the discussion, we realized that we needed to better elaborate
      on the biological background and market demand for our project. Additionally, it became clear that the software's
      user-friendliness required improvement, with more user guidance needed within the interface to ensure a smoother
      experience for customers. This feedback provided valuable direction for refining our project.</p>

    <p class='bold'>Addressing Technological Inequality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class='bold'>Academic Discounts</span>: By offering discounts to academic institutions or students, the
        barriers to accessing technology are lowered, helping to bridge the gap of technological inequality.
      </li>
      <li><span class='bold'>Nonprofit Projects</span>: Launch nonprofit initiatives to make this technology available
        to more low-income regions and groups, thus mitigating the impact of technological inequality.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class='bold'>Responding to Changes in the Job Market:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class='bold'>Skill Enhancement Programs</span>: Develop training programs to help the workforce adapt to
        new technological environments and improve their skill levels.

    <p>To strengthen our project's commercial viability, we engaged in insightful discussions with Yanyin, a high-tech
      company focused on providing digital platforms for the biopharmaceutical field, to learn from their extensive
      business experience. This exchange provided us with valuable knowledge on how to effectively transition from
      research to marketable products, covering key areas such as commercialization strategies, market positioning, and
      sustainable growth. The insights gained from this collaboration will guide us in refining our own business
      approach and enhancing the long-term impact of our project.</p>
